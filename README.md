This is a C program that lets users input up to 4 artists and their songs (up to 3 songs per artist). The program sorts the artists and their songs alphabetically, then creates a shuffled playlist where no song repeats within the last 5 songs played.
To set up, clone the repository, compile the program then run the executable. Follow the prompts to enter the Artists and their songs and evrrything will be done automatically.
